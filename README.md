# Online Food Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes online food ordering behavior based on demographic factors. It utilizes a dataset containing various attributes such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, monthly income, educational qualifications, family size, pin code, output, and feedback. By analyzing this data, the project aims to gain insights into customer preferences, improve service quality, and potentially predict customer behavior.


Data Exploration: We analyzed a dataset related to online food ordering behavior. The dataset included various attributes such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, monthly income, educational qualifications, family size, pin code, output, and feedback.
Data Presentation: We presented the dataset in a tabular format using HTML without using CSS or JavaScript. Each attribute was displayed in a separate column, making it easy to read and understand.
Styling: You requested to style the HTML pages without using CSS or JavaScript. We achieved this by directly applying inline styles to the HTML elements. For example, we set background colors for the pages and styled the header, navigation, main content, and footer accordingly.
HTML Pages: We created multiple HTML pages for different purposes. The index.html page served as the homepage, providing an overview of the project and its goals. The data.html page displayed the dataset in a tabular format. The about.html page offered additional information about the project.

Overall, we worked on structuring and presenting the dataset effectively in HTML, ensuring readability and clarity for anyone viewing the data.
